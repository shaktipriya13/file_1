# In Python, the `id()` function is used to get the unique identifier (memory address) of an object. When you pass an object to the `id()` function, it returns a number that represents the memory address of that object. This identifier is unique for each object during its lifetime.

# Here's how you can use the `id()` function with a list:

# ```python
# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# list_id = id(my_list)
# print(list_id)
# ```

# The `list_id` variable will contain the memory address of the `my_list` object. Keep in mind that this address is not guaranteed to remain the same if the object is modified or if it's created again. The `id()` function is primarily used for low-level operations and debugging, and you typically don't need to use it in everyday Python programming. It's more common to use other methods and functions to work with lists, such as `append()`, `insert()`, and `pop()`, among others.
